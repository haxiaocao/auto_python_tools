File Endings give the user and the system an indicator about the content of a file. Reasonable file endings for configuration files are

*config.py for Python files
*.yaml or *.yml if the configuration is done in YAML format
*.json for configuration files written in JSON format
*.cfg or *.conf to indicate that it is a configuration file
*.ini for "initialization" are quite widespread (see Wiki)
~/.[my_app_name]rc is a VERY common naming scheme for configuration files on Linux systems. RC is a reference to an old computer system and means "run common".
That said, I think I prefer *.conf. I think it is a choice that users understand.

But you might also consider that *.ini might get opened by standard in a text editor. For the other options, users might get asked which program they want to use.
